In [[Back Control]], with one arm above their arm, and one arm under their arm I can do what is called the zipper choke. To start, make sure my hooks are in. 


Take my under arm and fold the gi's lapel back on itself. Tak my attacking arm (the over their arm) and grab high up on the opposite side of their heads lapel with a grasp that ideally contains a folded lapel. Pull my attacking arm in towards my body. I should be able to execute this submission one handed, but if I can't another option is using my other hand to pull out the slack in the gi fabric that is behind the neck by pulling down on the opposite side of the lapel.
