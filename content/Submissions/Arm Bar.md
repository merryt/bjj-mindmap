# General Tips
- When I am about to execute the move I need to control 1 joint closer to the torso then what I am attacking. An arm bar is attacking the elbow, so I need to control the shoulder. I do this by pinching their shoulder between my butt and foot. My foot is ideally on the far side of their head pressing them away from the joint attack

	- Don't focus on specific grips - The focus is more the arms position
	- It is okay to cross your feet (be careful when they are trying to stack you though)
	- control the wrist and the shoulder. 
	- Don't worry about two hands during grip fighting while trying to fight

# Starting from [[Top Lock]]: 
At this point I assume their inside arm is parallel to my spine, perhaps laying on my chest. I want to hold the arm that is on my chest with my arm that is opposite their arm. With my free arm I want to grab my shin with the opposite side hand behind their head. I then free my leg from the cross to press against the ground or hip and rotate on my back taking their arm with me. we should be spinning to break their arms alignment even furthers. After I have rotated to ~45 degrees off center I then grab their arm with both hands and hold on tight. 1 hand on the back of their elbow, and the other grabbing Gi, or wrist is ideal. At the same time I place my free leg against the side of their face and start pressing till they are off balance. At this point of their elbow is still above my belt I can start bridging. 

# Far side Arm bar starting from [[Side control]]: 
Separate their arms from their sides. I do this with elbows and knees. Pry their far arm away from their side by putting my inner elbow around their arm and pulling it up with a back extension. I need their far arm to be straight and on the side of my head that is away from their shoulders. I can use my close are from this if I need to. I then pinch their arm against my head and shoulder.  For the near arm use my knee that is closer to their hips to press in between their side and their arm. If I need to twist my body to get a better angle do so, but never give up my arm under their head or my base. As long as I have my base, and arm under their head I can cook. Once both arms are pried away from their sides I can start to transition. I do this by first trapping the near arm under my leg that is closer to their hips. I can then then pull their far arm up by my head and tilt them onto their side  so their shoulders are stacked. I need to keep something behind their back to stop them from rolling over, this could be my knee, or an arm. If their arm is at their waist it is probably better to go for a [[Kimura#From side control]].  Once they are stacked I take my free leg/foot (the one that is near their head and not pinning their leg) and place it behind their back. It should be as close to their back as possible to stop them from putting their back against the ground. Lower my butt onto the mat behind their back, and pull close to them. Then put my leg that was pinning next to their head/shoulder away from my body. I use my arms to hold their arm against my head. I can then swing my arm over their torso and lean back to finish the submission. 

# Near side arm bar from [[Side control]]:
From side control I can start with isolating the far side arm. I put one arm under their head, and the other arm under their far side arm. Both hands press into the shoulder. I can then put pressure into their head/neck with my shoulder and raise up onto my knees. Once on my knees I can stack their shoulders. If they are keeping their hips flat on the ground then I can transfer to [[Mount]] by slicing a knee across their stomach toward their arm pit. If they are stacking their hips, and their shoulders are still shelved on my knees then their arm is probably trying to get in between their chest and mine to create a frame, I want this. IF THEY DON'T I can arm bar from a vertical position, I can lock take an over hood on the arm that is behind my back and press my hips forward. If they do create a frame then I release my arm that is under their head and shoot it under their arm and grab into my own inner elbow, this might require a wide blade motion where I do a big arm circle. I then take my arm that is closer to theirs and grab the wrist of the arm that is nearer to me. This is called a figure 4 grip. From here I keep them shelved/stacked, and holding onto that grip. then slowly lower back toward the map, never letting go of the grip. In the process of going back I can put a leg or two over their body and go into the arm bar.

# From [[S-Mount]]:
Pass my free leg across their face and place my foot on the mat infront of them, and my shin on the ground under their shoulder. I should be controlling the arm connected to the elbow on that knees side. I do this by grabbing the other arm, at the bicep wrapping the target arm. If done correctly I have two paths at this point
- Face down - Post with my free arm, make sure the arm that is controlling them has their arm in the crook of my elbow and is close to their elbow, if I am at the wrist it is probably too weak. Lean over my posted arm and press their head back with the leg that is around their head. Bridge with hips
- Classic - If they have a strong grip that needs broken this is probably the right move. Control the arm that is closest to the leg that is across their face, do this by getting a two on one (preferably on different positions, like 1 bicep and one through and grabbing the lapel) and go backwards down onto the mat. From here start grip fighting using [[Arm Bar#Advice once I have a grip on the arm, and am seated next to them|pre-finishing mechanics]] 


# Defence:

The goal is to get my elbow under their belt line.
- getting their lower knee into my 1/2 guard is a great way to do this, I can then rotate my body, pull out my arm and sweep their position. NEVER give up my grips in this position though. My hands need to be connected. 
- Keep my arms connected, best with a rear naked choke grip, or gable grip, when they lean back go with them and rotate my body to pull my arm out.
- if they have a weak grip or are transitioning I can just pull it out


# Advice once I have a grip on the arm, and am seated next to them
- Grab my lapel with the arm that is closer their legs
- Keep weight on their head, try to get them to face away from me. If I need to let my leg off their face, then when they try to sit up put weight back on their face
- Grab their cross side lapel with the hand that is closer to their head, I can choke them by putting the blade of my hand against their neck
- I can use the hand that is closer to their neck to shoot inbetween their hands and with the blade of my hand pry open their grip
- I can use the inside of the hand with the lapel grip to apply upward pressure to their arm, I can then use my other hand to press down getting downward pressure and stress their forarm/elbow
- Double up both arms under their arm. I can use the arm that is closer to their head to pull their elbow to my side. I can then rotate their arm attacking the shoulder joint which will hopefully unlock their grip and allow me to finish the position.
