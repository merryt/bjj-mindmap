STARTING_POSITION:
  - "[[Closed Guard]]"
---

There are a few ways to get into this position, the easist is from open guard with a snap down via lapel grip. 

The core mechanic here is grip medium tight/deep on a cross collar grip. You then throw your arm up and over their head. From here you need to gain leverage. In class we learned two ways that I liked. 
	- Slide free arm beind the head and under the looping arm and pull up. 
	- spin body around partners back and fall over pulling partner with me. The end state should be two legs over the body and pulling collar toward me.
