STARTING_POSITION: BACK
---
Start in [[Back Control]] Rear naked choke, with only my attacking hand I want to blade between the neck and the chin, after I passed through that gap I want to get my palm on to the shoulder and hold on firmly.

Once my palm is resting on their shoulder I should be able to apply pressure by pulling my opposite side elbow toward by body using my anchored palm as the fulcrum. 

If I can't submit with one arm I can pull the arm out from the under hook, and place my elbow near their shoulder. I transition my under chin arm's hand to the inside of the elbow near the shoulder. The free palm blades behind the head. It can sweep behind the head from above, or can go behind the neck and slide up. If the person isn't giving my hand space to pass through I can attempt to choke at any point in time. Once the hand is behind the persons head I press the palm of that hand and my hips forward. At the same time tuck my elbows toward me slowly.
