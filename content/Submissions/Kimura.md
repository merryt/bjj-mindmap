# General Advice
For a Kimura attack my arm goes over the opposite shoulder. My same side hand grabs my opponents same side wrist. I use my over the shoulder arm to shoot through my opponents armpit and grab my own wrist. The general goal of this submission is to rotate the arm down and backwards 

# From mount:
Reach an arm up and around the opisite side of the head of my opponent and grab their wrist from behind their back. Connect with other arm through the opening

# From side control:
The setup is the same as  [[Arm Bar#Far side Arm bar starting from Side control]] BUT if they are gripping their belt 1/2 way through I should get knees on the ground on both side of them. pinning them to the ground and pull the arm up and out. I can apply more pressure by hooking an arm underneath and applying pressure with my back instead of my arms.
