# From Mount

1. Get my knees inside their arms
2. Establish a cross face with one arm
3. With my other arm, get under one of their elbows
5. Finger walk my hands up to pull out the slack of their elbow
6. Use my shoulder and core to press their elbow up. repeat previous step until their arm is above their head.
7. Lock their arm in place by putting my head to the ground behind their arm. Squeeze their shoulder between our heads.
8. (optional) Get their bicep and my arm under their chin line.
9. Pull out all the slack form my cross facing arm to get a good bite. This arm will be doing the attacking
	 - To establish the best bite there should be no air between the inside of my elbow and their neck. To accomplish any combination of the following:
		- Lift head and slide arm deeper in
		- try to finger walk my attacking hand under their head toward me.
		- wiggle the hand to gain more depth
10. (optional) get a gable grip with my hands so one of my biceps is on the other side of their head. If I can't get this with one hand then it wasn't setup correctly.
11. knee on belly -> side control
12. squeeze for body triangle
