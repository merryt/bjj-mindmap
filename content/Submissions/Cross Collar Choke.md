1. Break posture 
	- If their hands are on my hips blade my hands under their arms
	- Press their arms out and grab behind their back/neck
	- Use legs to pull them forward
2. If I have a single underhook consider a [[Top Lock]] instead, if I have double overs (and still around their neck) I can start with establishing grips.
3. take my choking hand (first hand in) and blade under their Gi. 
4. take my support hand to get a fist of gi
5. Roll my choking arm over their head to the cross side never getting rid of the grip
6. Roll my supporting arm over their head to the opposite sides
7. Extend my wrists like I am flyfishing
