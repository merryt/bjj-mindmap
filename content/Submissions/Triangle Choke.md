# General Advice
If I am bottom and attacking I want to create the triangle with 3 parts. 
1. My calf against the back of their head
2. My thigh against their neck
3. Their arm/shoulder 


# Attacking
If their inside arm is flat on the same side as their shoulder I can bridge and take a two on 1 on that wrist to move it to the other side. 

Once the arm is across their body it is time to lock in the triangle. This is done by placing my hand on the shin of my leg that is crossed behind their neck. At this point I can set myself up for success by pushing and pulling my quad/hamstring against the side of their head to let out all the slack. I then place my now free leg on the ground or their hip. I use this new leverage to rotate my body tightening the triangle. If they still haven't tapped I an pull their head down, and squeeze. 


(I can get to this position from [[Half Guard]])

# Advice from bottom guard.
If I am coming to this position from [[Closed Guard#Bottom]] then I want to use the knee from the side of the body that is opposite the arm I control and use it to press their arm/shoulder back and put their upper body at an angle. I can then swing my leg over top and grab control at the ankle. From here I can continue the steps above
