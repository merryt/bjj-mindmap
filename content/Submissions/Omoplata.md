# Defence
To defend against the omoplata be a ninja and roll, it can be forward, or to the side away from the opponent


# Offence
#### [[Closed Guard]]
- Start by breaking their posture and pulling them close. Ideally I should be a little offset to the side I am going to attack
- grab the arm I am going to attack and push it back toward their hip
- slide a leg up and over their head
- cross my legs over each other and sit up
- Grab their hips on the opposite side ( or their belt)
- Lean forward slowly and attack the shoulder


#### From Triangle
If they are defending in the Triangle by hiding their arm there is a chance I can do an omoplata here. I start by reaching to their belt on the same side as the arm they are hiding. I have to objectives at this point
	1. Stop them from rolling forward
	2. Stop them from freeing their arm
To accomplish these goals I want to grab some pant and pull my self toward them, once I am close enough that I can use my feet to help rotate around I want to throw the same arm that was on their pants over their back and get as close to their body as possible. Here I want to S-sit and push my weight over their body. Their arm should be in my lap bent at a bad angle and cause them to tap. If it doesn't cry and take the back. We'll get um next time.
