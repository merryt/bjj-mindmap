# Bottom
- If I open my ankles I can keep my knees pressed in against their sides. 

### Attacks
- [[Omoplata]]
- [[Arm Bar]]
- [[Cross Collar Choke]]
- [[Top Lock|Triange position]] and potentially [[Triangle Choke]]
- [[Kimura]] (mostly a fake or transition to [[Omoplata]])

### Sweeps
- [[Hip Bump]]
- [[Stomp sweep]]
- Scissor sweep
- Slide into [[K Guard]]
	- Get a scoop and pull myself close. 
	- Shoot my scoop hand through and reach my non-scoop hand around to gable(?) grip it. 
	- Release my foot that isn't on the gripping side
	- With my connected foot (same side as gable grip) press my opponent away
		- This process should rotate my body so I am sideways compared to my partner. I am now in [[K Guard]]
- [[Climb to the back]]
- [[Flower Sweep]]



# Top
- Use my thighs and elbows to create space between my lats/hips and their legs. From there I open up more opportunities for sweeps, I do not want them squeezing their legs into my sides
- Overhooks, if they post, or go for a shallow underhook I can over hook their hands. It seems really powerful and there are sweeps where I just overhook one side and bridge with the other side
- To stop some sweeps
	- If my partner raises his hips for a sweep I can put my hand on their hips to stop them from getting height.
	- I can use their newly opened legs to stand up and move to their back. hip sitting if necessary.
