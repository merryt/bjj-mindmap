From side control top I can transition to [[Knee on belly]] by popping up like I am surfing. When doing this make sure I control their hips by putting my arm across their waist and replacing it with my knee when I stand up.

### Cheap submissions
##### Far side wrist lock
- If they frame high with their far side arm into my chest I can start on this move
- Grab their elbow with my lower arm (closer to their waste)
- Pull that arm closer to me while pinching their hand with my chin
##### Capturing an arm under my leg
- If they are framing against my hips on the near side I am in business
- Start by taking the knee that is closer to their head and making a swinging motion from inside to you. This should put that knee under their armpit then over their arm.
- Press my leg down pinning their arm to the ground with my shin
- Slide my shin up their arm till it is closer to their core then their elbow
- Two approaches to the next section
	- Posture up and hope they put their forarm between my shin and my theight (potentially assist with my hand)
	- Move my leg (that is not pinning) away from their torso, and catch their pinned hand with my knee. Return my leg to its resting place. When their hand/forarm falls between my theigh and shin put pressure on it trapping it there
- pull my shin back into the elbow to lock in the position
- there are two submissions here
	- bicep slicer 
		- press my weight down into the bicep
	- wrist lock
		- put their for arm directly up into the air and put my weight down on the wrist. 
 ##### Von Flue Choke (Shoulder Choke)
- [tips video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkgswsS78cs)
- Get my shoulder under the chin. 
- Shoot my farside arm deep under their shoulder and connect my hands with a gable grip
- Rotate my entire body so that I wedge the chin up, exposing the neck
- press my weight down on the throat (not across like a cross face)

# Bottom
When I am scrambling and it looks like I will fall into bottom of side control I need to be connecting my knee and elbow on the side of the person in side control. The overall goal of escaping from bottom is to penetrate wedges and the best place to start is near side wedges (my arm that is unable to touch my side because their knee/thigh is there). Always stop them from crossing over to mount my by keeping my knees heigh and feeling for their motion.

If I am getting crossfaced, try to slip a frame inbetween my neck and their arm, then press into the cross face. Jordan Teaches JiuJitsu's number 1 rule is don't let anyone control your neck. After I have a frame stopping the cross face get both arms into that space and start creating a little bit of space

##### Knee + Elbow escape
- [Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuXq-k__9lQ)
- Nearside elbow in between their legs. If I can't slide it by thighs, then it is okay to briefly turn my hips away to generate a bit of space, but once I am inside turn back.
- Connect my knee and elbow - 
	- against skilled opponents I won't be able to do this at the ground level, but I should be able to do this at the hip. 
	- I can move my hips away from my partner to give myself more space on the inside, but I should keep my instep ready to stop them from mounting me, and my arms frame against their hip with my hand almost at their side to stop rotation to north south.
- Once I have knee + elbow connection then I can press against their thigh (if I need more leverage I can connect my feet together and press both down)
- Pressing against their body should rotate my body so we are parallel 
- Reset my frame (that was knee elbow) to under their armpit so I can control the inside position
- Move my knee (that was part of knee elbow) across and claim a butterfly hook on their inside thigh
- slide them back with a press and situp


##### To [[Turtle Guard]]
- Shrimp away
- Roll so I am flat on my belly
- Slide knees under body 


# General principals
- The closer to parallel the spines of the two players are the less stable the top player is and the easier they are to sweep. 
- Weight is less important then stoping rotation. **Wedging is the basis of pinning**. "Pressure" from above is really not that valuable. but stoping rotation is. So a cross face that doesn't stop rotation isn't useful
