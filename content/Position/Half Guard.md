In half guard the bottom player is 1 elbow escape away turning the position around

#todo lots of transitions here, move this to transitions

Half guard has a few states:
- [[Shallow Half Guard]] is where the bottom player has no leg shields/frames and only has the ankle grabbed with their feet. I find myself as the bottom player getting to this position from mount. This postion is still pretty good for the top player, they can [[Leg slice]] to free that leg
- Regular half guard. The bottom player has a some frames or knee shields up. For their sake they hopefully have aren't flattened and are up on their forarm. This is a good position for bottom player because they have attacking, transitioning, and sweeping options. 
- Half guard with knee shield. aka [[Z Guard]] 
- Deep half guard - There are no knee shields/frames but the bottom player has grasped their legs high around the top players thigh. This position is pretty even, maybe top has an advantage, but from what I understand no one is feeling good about their position here.

# Top
**
- **Removing knee shield** - If they have a knee shield in try the steps from [[Z Guard]] to remove it
- **Flatten them out** - When I am deep half guard top, the play is to get a weak cross face, and them walk/lean my hips into them to flatten them from the waist first, then get heavy with the upper body -
	- If they have an underhook my first step is to flatten the underhook and then punch my near side arm under their near side arm pit and walk them backwards. My goal is to push near side back, and pull far side forward. 
- to flatten their arm base above/near their head. 
- Controls
	- Nearside underhook (best)
	- Farside underhook
		- Grab a nearside underhook
		- Once I have stability try to get the far side underhook, if they let me pummel under the arm press it forward, 
		- Is I can't pummel an arm in then press their leg down, if they don't react enjoy the 3/4 mount or full mount. IF the do stop me with my arm THEN pummel under. 
		- Once I am pummeled under walk my hand up to solidify the position. For extra stability rest that hand on the ground instead of cupping the shoulder
- Pass: 
	- [[Half guard smash pass]]
	-  Knee slice with a far side under hook:
		- Using my free arm I want to get under their far arm and establish and underhook. 
		- Place my head on the ground and point my near side foot away from their body to establish base
		- If I can't do this I can press their leg down and try to press their leg down until I have [[Three quarter mount]], if they defend that I can shoot my hand under their arm and take the under hook.
		- Stack my hips onto their stomach or ground, then free my knee line and take side control.


# Bottom
- Shields/frames: My goal is to get the inside and put an arm/leg/shin between me and the player on top.

### Escapes

##### Early (I have knee shield or frames)
- [[Half Guard Bottom Escape via shrimp]]
- [[Half guard bottom escape via roll]]
- [[Half guard to butterfly]]
- If I start with a knee shield up I can drop the knee shield at the same time I strike for a [[Kimura]]. This feels really risky to me, but maybe it is just lack of practice
- A [[Kimura]] is available from this position assuming I am stable with a knee shield and can reach across their body.
- Triangle
	- Near side knee guard
	- Get a Nearside overhook and grab the lapel
	- control the farside wrist and push it out. 
	- Pull my inside leg through and put in over the shoulder and close the [[Top Lock]] and start on the [[Triangle Choke]]
##### Late (Chest to chest)
- Lockdown sweep - From half guard my outside leg goes over my partners leg, then clips in under my inside leg. I then take my inside leg and hook it under their ankle. If there is a crossface use my arms coupled with leg control to give my self some breathing room. Get my arms under their armpits. Lift their full body up and over my head and roll. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ7eQkPU4ms 
- To dog fighter - From a half guard where my chest is on the opposite side of my hips outside of chest to chest I can do this escape. I start with grabbing the their back on the same side I have their leg, from here I can pull myself up. If they don't grab a wizzer I can take their back, if they do I can grab their knee on the opposite side and pull them down and get on top. 
- Answer to farside underhook
	- Pinch their leg between mine
	- pivot my legs (not bridge) forcing them to base to the far side
	- recapture my inside frame
- [[Coyote Guard]] - Get under my opponent
	- This is best done if they don't have any under hooks
	- Curl into a ball and try to get my head to their far side thigh. 
	- Scoop the leg
