This is a type of [[Half Guard]]

# Bottom
Grips: 
- Far side arm: Try to shoot through their legs and grab their far side foot, or get a scoop
- Near side: Underhook to the belt is good, OR if they get an underhook I can reach under their arm and grab a lapel for a modified underhook (this needs a better name)

Head: To get to this position I need to pull my head close to their far side thigh. The closer I am to their thigh the harder it is for them to pummel in and get an over or under hook on far side. 

Legs: 
- Getting my far side leg under their ankle is my primary place of attacking. Once I have control of that I can pull it to off balance them for sweeps, or use it to slide my inside leg out to get to [[Dog Fight]]

Sweeps/transitions:
- Sweep to [dogfight]
- Get knee shields in
- John Wane?
