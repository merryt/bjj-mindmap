This is a variant of [[Half Guard]]. The difference is that there is a knee shield in.

# Top
If their knee shield is high:
- scoop their lower leg up
- pummel my arm that is same side as the knee shield into the middle
- Fall into [[Half Guard]]

If their knee shield is low
- Press the knee shield it down with my shoulder.
- Press their none knee shield leg forward with my same side ankle
- Place my knee shield sided arm in front of the shin with my palm on the ground
- With my non-knee shield side arm grab the ankle of the knee shield. 
- Keep my weight on the knee shield
- Rotate my body away from their legs and fall into side control [[Side control]].

If their knee is perfect
- Shoot my arm behind their knee shield and in front of their base leg. 
- Twist and flatten their knee shield. 
- Fall forward so my belly/chest is over them. 
- This should result in [[Half Guard]]

If their ankles are locked
- Sprawl to unlock the ankles.
