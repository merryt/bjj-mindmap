\This position is similar to back control, but rotated. Lots of the general rules apply (hooks, neck as target). It does seem to be slightly less dominant then back
# Bottom
- Protect my neck - Cross arms with palms out near neck. If they go for a choke I can grab their arms
- Block against inserting hooks - Use my elbows to block against my partner trying to take underhooks, or get a leg to hook around my torso

### Transitions
##### From North/South
- If they have weak pressure I can slide back and pull [[Closed Guard]] or open guard.
- If the grab behind my but or weekly on my sides I can:
	- sweep through to a side (like a defensive lineman)
	- swing around and take their back
- If they lock arms around my torso
	- pinch their arms and roll me and my partner to our backs. 
	- Rotate my hips to be perpendicular to their body
	- spin my body to take side control

##### From Behind
- Core goal is to control an arm, and spin around. I can pinch a hand under my arm and roll, OR I can grab a hand with my hand, spin on my back, and get into guard (this seems risky though.)

# Top
- Question if I should switch to MMA so I can start striking
- My current best approach is stay off to one side, grab a seatbelt grip but a hook in on the close side, fall to the close side and try to get upper hook in.
