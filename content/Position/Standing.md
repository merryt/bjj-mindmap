# How to stand
### Posture 
Easiest way to get your posture right is to lean forward, put your hands on your knees, lock your core/legs, and then put your hands out. 

I do not want my head or my hands past my knees. Head in front will lead to you getting guillotined, hands in front will lead to an [[Arm Drag]]. 

### Hands
if your fingers are pointing up you are in a better position to attack, if your fingers are pointing down you are in a better position to defend

### Legs
The leg that is in the front is your vulnerable leg, the leg that is in the back is the safe leg. 


# Engaging
The easiest thing to do for engaging is taking the arm that is on the safe side of my defensive leg and holding it out a little farther then needed and engaging on the bicep.  From here I can get a collar grip, or behind the head

### Moving their legs
If my grips are secured I can force them to move their legs by stepping back and twisting my upper body. if I twist clockwise their right foot will come closer to me, and inverted on the left side

### The power of the head
- Keep my head at or lower then my opponent. 
- Ear to ear is a tied position. Only do it if I have far superior grips (for my level that means both under)
- Pressing the crown/top of my head into their head is very powerful. If I can get this position I can just press against them and push. If I do this they will off balance. While that is going their legs will be an afterthought and I can pick one.

### Grips
Make sure my thumb is not on the same side as my fingers. If my thumb and fingers are on the same side it makes it so easy to break the position. At my level don't accept an outside position, try to fight to get inside position. 

If I am realizing they are gripping with their thumbs up I can pop their hands up and shoot inside.
