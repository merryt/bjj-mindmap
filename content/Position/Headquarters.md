### Passes

##### [Headquarters passing simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM3u9Jxthg)  (when leg is pinned to the ground)
- Keep their far side leg pinned to ground with my far side shin
- Put hands on the ground above partners head. 
- Pummel a leg back to hook around an ankle and pull it down. Slide into [[Mount]].
- If their contained knee/hips are facing:
	- Near side: (knee cut) start with a far side underhook and then drop my far side knee to the near side pinning their near side knee to the ground. 
	- Far side: (side smash) get a near side underhook. Pass my near side knee under their leg and to the far side ground. (keep it close to their hips)

- Grab the pant leg of the farside leg to stop it from floating. Make sure that grip is to the OUTSIDE on the shin. If its on the inside I struggle with lassos
- With the nearside arm grab same side lapel
- If they don't have a strong hook with their near side leg and are trying to break grips I can backstep and pass nearside.
- If they are pushing my hips back, but not controlling my upper body I can press my head into their chest and pass nearside
- If they put their farside leg to the ground to gain mobility I should initiate a knee cut because by moving their hips they have created a weakness in their near side knee shield.
- If they are trying to lift me overhead
	- Nearside leg is back
	- Nearside arm is stiff arming
- If their knee/hips are pressed against my farside hip then I should be doing a side smash
	- The moment I have past the knee line grab the arm to stop them from posting
	- Get a nearside(from starting position) under hook
	- Make sure I am stretching out their far side leg with my instep before attempting to take mount.
- If their knee/hips are pressed against my nearside hip then I can knee cut. 
- I can also barenbolo from here.


# Bottom
Goals: 
- Don't get my knee passed -> frame against their shoulders with my arms
- Off balancing. (Alternating between these three can lead to situations where I can attack)
	- Up and over -> Using my near side shin I can lift them up into the air, if I do this in conjunction with pressing their farside leg back from a pant grip and pulling them with a cross colar grip I can force them to post around my head
	- Farside sweep -> If I have control over their farside ankle I can use my nearside leg to press them over their farside foot and hopefully sweep them
	- Resetting back -> If my shin is up I can use my collar grip + nearside leg to push them away from me and get more lever age for the other off blancing attacks
Things to try:
- Get a lasso with my far side leg
