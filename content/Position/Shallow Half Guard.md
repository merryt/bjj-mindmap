Shallow half guard is when the top players knee has crossed the hip line. This is normally due to a kneeslice or a smashed knee shield. If the top players knees are on opposite sides of the bottom player this position is alternative called [[Shallow Half Guard|3/4 mount]],

## Top
I need to stop my opponent from making horizontal movement with their head and upper body. The best way to do this is underhook on one side, and head on the other side.


- Get a wide base pressing both my feet into the ground. 
- Drop the knee of my trapped leg to one side of their body. if in side control drop my body weight low to solidify the position. If in mount try to grab hooks. Once I have hooks try to put my head to the ground on the opposite side of the underhook

## Bottom
- If all I have is a shallow half guard and they have smashed me keep climbing up the their leg, try to get a deep half guard, then wrap my outside leg around theirs. Get my instep around their instep. This can be very annoying.
- Another goal is get outside, if I can get the under hook and grab their belt I can attempt to start climbing up and make my way to the back.
