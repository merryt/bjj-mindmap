# Sub positions of mount
- Low (standard) mount
- High mount
- [[S-Mount]]

# Top 
Offensive things to consider:
- Leg positions. I want to keep my legs safe from getting tied up and placed into half guard. There are a few ways to do this
	- Legs under their lower back
	- Grape vine 
	- Heals in crooks of knees
- Maintaining base - most of the defensive moves here are to press or roll me off of them. To defend against this I need to stay heavy and stable. Stability mostly comes from my arms (head), weight comes from my legs. If my legs are wrapped around their torso or under their knees I can squeeze and press my torso into them pinning them into the ground making myself vary hard to pry off. To not get rolled I need to keep my arms away from their center line. The more spread out I am the more I can post if I need to. I can also use my head as a post if I am manipulating an arm
- If they get an ankle don't panic, cross face in the opposite direction their hips are facing so their spin is twisted. Grab their back on the opposite side of the cross face and twist their spine. The tighter this is the less they will focus on their knee. Pull my knee in so it is next to their belt line making it hard to capture it. Then take my other ankle and use it to open their legs that are trapping my ankle.
- My goal is to get underhook(s) and move up the body and position hierarchy

# Bottom

### General concepts 

When I am bottom, **Keep my elbows close to my sides**, and preferable against the meat of their thigh. I want their feed to me outside of my knee lines so I can rotate my hips and capture a foot to transition to [[Half Guard]]. When my elbow are inside I can stop them from advancing to highmount, and can press against their hips same side. If they transition to high mount, then need to switch to getting cross side frames on the hips (single or double).

Watch out for ezekiel chokes by keeping my neck pressed against the mat, if an arm goes behind my head time to [protect ya neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_-3Bh1VFI8)
### Low Mount Crowning
Try to keep an inside elbow to stop them from advancing to high mount.
- [[Basic mount escape]]
- [[knee and elbow escape from mount]]
### Low mount pressed forward
- Hip raise with a kipping - the one option I have if they aren't heavy is to raise their hips with my arms and legs, then drop my legs between their legs and go to [[Butterfly Guard]] or [[x guard]].
- Open knee escape - I can rotate my hips past the point of stacked and bridge. From here I can push and shrimp and sneak out.
- [[Bridge and roll aka ompa]] -  (this works best when their feet and knees are narrow) 

### High Mount 
If possible shoulder walk to reduce how high they are
- (If one arm is isolated) Bridge to the side of the isolated arm and when they post move that arm back to framing
- (It two arms are isolated) Penetrate with my knee(s) under their butt and try to lift them up
