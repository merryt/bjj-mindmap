There are 3 stages to passing an open guard. 
1. Getting past hips/legs. - The control of open guard is between the bottom players knees. The push/pull of the position is the attacker trying to move their center of gravity past that central postion.
2. Controlling core - After the legs have been passed and you are in the "j spot" (hip pocket) the next point of interest is the knee elbow connection from the bottom player. 
3. Chest to chest. - The pass is only complete when chest to chest have been acheived.

Basic passing plan in no-gi when opponent is in a supine postion is:
- Using a combination of side steps and crescent steps position a leg next to the bottom players hips. this is called the j spot. Ideally my toes should be facing away from their head.
- Press an arm onto their farside hip to stop them from spinning
- If they are framing against my shoulders wiggle shoulders back and forth to remove frames
- If they have knee elbow connection insert my knee under that connection


Clearing frames. 
- It is hard to clear frames when you have weight on them. If I am getting framed:
	- Back up (releasing weight)
	- Clear frame 
	- Reassert pressure
- Never go into frames 
	- If bottom player is framing with arms don't go directly to the head
- Don't present square shoulders to arm frames. turn shoulders against frames.

- Don't chase the head until you have beaten the hips
- If you aren't stable for knee on belly anchor by grabbing behind the head.


# Bottom
- Knee elbow connection can buy a lot of time and wear out my opponent
- while contesting side control if there is a gap between the top players hip, and the bottom players hip slide a knee into it and reset guard.
- Swinging my far side leg between my partners legs can allow me to pivot and reestablish my position
- My legs are stronger at pushing then anyone who is pressing against me, feel free to push people back
