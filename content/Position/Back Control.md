# Attacking
##### Arms aka Grips (the seatbelt):
- The person in the advantaged positions should always keep their hands clasped in a position where if the disadvantaged person goes two-on-one with the advantaged clasped hand then the hand that is free should be the upper/attacking hand. This means the attacking hand/arm does not grab onto the lower hand, but the lower hand grabs onto the upper. 
- Elbows should always be pressed against the body and arms pulled in tightly. There should be no space between my arms and their body.
- Grip fighting from advantage:
	- Keep the seatbelt tight. A loose seatbelt exposes several different escapes. 
	- The person in the advantaged position should strive to keep their attacking elbow at or in front of the shoulder of the disadvantaged position. The clasp/grip should be under the armpit. If the grip is stripped the attacking arm ship shoot under the neck. 
	- Pinning an arm. To do this I take my under hooked arm (preferably if it is farther off the ground then my attacking arm) and get an above grip on my partners wrist on their higher side. Detach my leg that is on the same side as my partners arm that I am grabbing. place their arm underneath my leg, using my heal to apply additional power. Regain my hook from the leg that was just moved to pin their arm between their body and my leg. This gives me a permanent 2 on 1 advantage for future grip fighting.
	- If I am in a grip fight and the person is two on one-ing my attacking hand
		- If both grips are a monkey grip and both palms are facing the same way I can use my non attacking hand to grab their lapel to lock them into position. I can then free my attacking hand by going down, and then pulling free. Once free I can attempt to sneak my hand under the chin by blading my hand through
		- I can walk my hand up their shoulder like a spider. Once the hand is resting behind the shoulder I can do a [[Rear naked choke]] (specifically the one arm variation)

Falling to the "good" side. The "attacking" arm is in a stronger position if its on top


##### Legs
- **Body Triangle** - If the person in the back can get one of their legs across the belly, and place it behind their knee to squeeze the core that is a good spot. 
- **Ankle Lock** - The person in the back needs hooks in to maintain control, but needs to be careful not to hook to low, if the hooks of the back person are ever too low the front person can squeeze their legs together and get a submission there
- **Hooks spreading legs** - The person in the advantaged position can place the instep of their feet on the inside of the thighs of the disadvantaged person. This gives them partial control over the legs and allows them to grip pretty well to stop escape. 
- **High feet** - not locking feet, but having them high on the person is a solid choice. 
- **High locked feet** -  Locking feet is OKAY, but it needs to be done above the waist
- **Only one hook** - If the person in defensive position gets one hook out, but the leg is still under them, keep the foot away! Try to lever up your knee so it scoots them back to the center. Roll to the other side where you can reclaim both hooks.


##### Head
- While attacking I want my head to be squeezing their head into my attacking arm. My head should constantly be breaking their alignment.

Submissions I know
- [[Rear naked choke]]
- [[Zipper]]
- [[Bow and arrow]]

Reclaiming back control when I am losing it:
If the disadvantaged person gets their back the advantaged person will default to reclaim back control by trying to get under them to get under them. This is counter intuitive. Instead the advantaged person should attempt to roll them onto their side or by getting on top of them and pulling the seatbelt around. From here they can hook a leg around a leg and roll back into back control. 


# Defending
If I am in the disadvantaged position of [[Back Control]] I need to be pondering "can I be submitted here" if so, stop that submission. If not, I need to be moving to transition to a better position.  

Ways to stop from getting choked
- Grab inside of attacking elbow with lego man grip. Bench press forarm away from me
- Two hands on attacking hand - This works best if there is a loose/no seatbelt and the attacking arm is lower to the ground. As the defender I grab the wrist of the attacking hand with both my hands. I push that arm out of the way and roll to get my back to the ground
-
Easiest escapes
- Worm and squirm - This works is there is double underhooks or double overhooks. 
	- Going up -> if they have double underhooks I can squirm up. Grab their wrists with my hands. try to decrease pressure. From here I can walk my shoulders, step with my legs and try to go up and out. 
	- Going down -> If they are trying to attack with both hands I can use my feet to walk downwards. The risk here is getting trapped in a body triange, or getting submitted, so make sure to protect my neck and stop their legs from connecting.
- Back to ground - I clear these items one at a time: 
	- Hook
	- Knee
	- Head
	- Frame
	- Escape
	


Throwing off the advantaged persons alignment. I can use my head to press into their head and hopefully force their body into a less then optimal position.
