# General

Half butterfly is a position I personally find myself in a lot. It is close to a 50/50 position. The pivotal decider for the position is based on control of the under hooks, head, and the space in front of the bottom player. 


# Bottom
If I am spacing square into my partner I need to pivot my body. I want my leg with the hook to be on the far side of their body. This allows me better potential for the butterfly sweep.

General goals for bottom player
- Off balance the top player and get a hand on the mat across their body. (this opens up an [[Arm Drag#From Butterfly (and half butterfly)|Arm Bar from Half Butterfly]])
- [[Butterfly sweep]]
- Knee should be pointing up or toward my opponent, a knee smashed to the ground isn't useful.
- Protect against near side underhooks
- Get an opposite collar side grip, scoop the leg on the side of the grip, control the leg and get sideways. 
# Top
Golden Rule from [[Go Further Faster]] volume 53: 
> Move your hips TOWARD the hook, never away from it. 

Goals for the top player:
- John Danaher's flattening move
	- Walk your feat toward the hook, so it is past pointing up
	- With Near side underhood (Ideal):
		- Get a near side under hook (the side that doesn't have the hook)
		- I might need to blade in
		- Plant my head on the far side (same side as the butterfly hook) side pinning their head in place
		- Flatten the bottom players knee. 
		- Pummel near side foot between his feet
		- Walk far side leg up and push the butterfly hook inbetwen legs with my arm. 
		- End in [[Three quarter mount]]
	- With nearside crossface (works, but not ideal):
		- Reach arm behind head grabbing the lat
		- squeeze the lat closer to my my face with the bicep
		- Press my head to the floor by my hand
		- Step over the butterfly hook  (4 points on contact are head, leg on each side and post on far side)
		- step your far side leg over to the near side to gain side control
- Body lock
	- Danial hasn't taught us this yet
