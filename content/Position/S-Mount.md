This is a type of [[Mount]]. It is a continuation from high mount. Instead of the top players having both of their knees next to the bottom players head on of them is rotated so the foot is next to the head. 

S-Mount is a dominant position assuming top has control of both arms. 


# Top
My options from here
- (highest percentage) [[Arm Bar]] (seated and falling back into a normal arm bar)
- Returning to regular mount
- [[Top Lock]]

# Bottom
- Off balancing the top player by bridging or my shoulders to force them back to [[Mount#High Mount|high mount]]
- Pull arms close to my side. When my partner goes for an [[Arm Bar]] or [[Top Lock]] I am hopeful I can pull close and escape in the transition.
