After the ankles are locked behind the back feel good, you are in a good position. 

The options I have learned from this position are:
- [[Omoplata]]
- [[Triangle Choke]]
- [[Arm Bar]]

The differentiation between which position I should be going for seems to be mostly determined by their inside arm. If they are hiding this arm under my butt, or against their inner thigh then its time to go [[Omoplata]]. If not, its time to start prying it across my body. The way I learned to do this was by bridging my hips and getting the arm at or above my hip level, then dropping my hips as a throw the arm across. If they are strong or sneaky they will stop the arm from going fully across my body. They could do this with pure strength or with using their other arm to stop the progress. If that is the case I can do a [[Arm Bar]]. If they didn't stop the motion then its time to do a [[Triangle Choke]]


# From [[Mount]]
- If I am 1 arm issolated and they are pressing against my hip holding an elbow tight against their side this is my time to try this
- Go use the leg that is getting pressed to go around the arm doing the pressing
- Place that ankle through their head and around to the other side of their body
- lock it in 
# From [[Closed Guard]] 
If they are posturing with their arm(s) on my hips, 
- Blade under their arms and press them outwards
- Use my legs to pull them toward me
- Gable grip behind their back. 
- If I have an underhook and an overhook I am in business. If I have double overs I should work toward [[Cross Collar Choke]]
- Shrimp with my but toward the underhook. 
- Move my over hook grip to their arm 
- Swing my far side (overhook side) leg through to above their shoulder. If they are colapsing I might need to make a stropping point where my foot rests on the inside of their arm.
- Once that leg is up and over their shoulder I  can start working toward submissions 

# From [[Closed Guard]] option 2
If their arms are on my collar 
- Capture both their arms in the middle
- move my feet to their hips
- rotate my knees to break down their arms and create a shield on one arm
	- Push that arm out of the way with my knee
- Hold the arm that is still inline with my spine with both arms
- Using the foot that is still on their hip (same side as their captured arm) press my hips into the air
- Throw the foot that was shileding into the air and chop down behind the neck 
- lower body to ground and lock in the [[Top Lock|Triangle Position]]. 
- Pull on their leg to get spines perpindicular
- pull in tight and close all the parts of the triange.
