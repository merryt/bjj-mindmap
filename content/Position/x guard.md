# Bottom
Bottom player is inbetween the legs of the top player. They have there "back" (closer to the back of the top player) leg up, with the instep of their foot in the hip joint of the top player. The instep of the front foot is behind the knee. Their back shoulder is on the shin of the top players leg. And their back arm under that same leg and holding onto the shin or thigh.

### Transitions
I can transition from here to [[K Guard]]

### Attacks
- Grab the pant leg of the non controlled leg, start pushing them up, if they start to go forward (toward our heads) I can roll side to side and stand up. (Make sure to shelf the leg that was connected to the pants). If they fall backwards step back from them as I stand up and take the sweep.
