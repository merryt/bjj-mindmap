This position is when one person raises up from bottom, but the other person has a wizzer

This position is similar to [[Coyote Guard]]
# Bottom
I find my self in this position a lot from bottom because it is an exit location from [[Half Guard#Bottom]]. 

To get there from half guard bottom:
	- Get an under hook on the side of their body then I have control of with my legs. They will be looking for underhooks because it is essential for them to pass, so this won't be easy. If they get an underhook fake a sweep so they need to post. When they go to post I can try again for the underhook
	- Push their weight away from my underhook. This can be done by pressing on the inside of their far side leg, or if I am in Gi, grip at their knee and press away. I might also be able to do this with my knee/leg
	- Rotate my shoulders to get them stacked
	- With my outside leg do the following
		- step over their leg.
		- end press my achilles against their leg.
		- Pull their foot a little bit into the air, If this isn't possible use my under hook+knee-to-butt to pull them forward. With their weight forward it should be easier to lift their foot into the air. 
		- **WARNING** - Go easy here. This is called a knee torque for a reason.
	- Pull my inside out using the gap that was created by lifting their nearside leg with my outside leg.
	- Rotate my hips, and rename my legs. What was once my inside leg is know my farside kneeling leg. My outside leg is now kneeling between their legs and will be called my nearside leg
	- Let my upper body follow. 


Transitions:
- Taking the back: If I ever find my opponent with out a wizzer, take the back
- Knee tap
	- Reach across under their body with my free arm and grab their knee. 
	- **WARNING** - If their shin is flayed away from their body don't just force this over because it places a ton of torque onto the knee and can cause damage. 
	- Pull their knee toward me and push forward causing them to fall onto their back
- Roll under (this work best when their knee is far away from you and they are using me for balance)
	- Dive my free arm under their body to get a scoop
	- Make sure I still have my knee torque in place (my nearside leg is capable of grabbign their leg)
	- Pull my partners weight ontop of me and then push them over to the other side
- Force post to back take
	- Fake a roll under, and akwardly pull them toward me
	- This should cause them to post near me with their arm that was the wizzer
	- with no wizzer take the back
- Arm Shuck
	- make my underhook go limp, 
	- pull it out
	- take the back
- Single leg. 
	- Using my free arm grab their nearside leg
	- get height and ideally to my feet keeping my weight on their back with my underhook
	- Rotate my body behind them 
	- Keep moving and rotating them till they fall onto their back/side
