Reverse de la riva is where the bottom player has 1 leg between the legs of the top player and their foot then goes out behind their knee on the same side as their other leg. 


### Levels
There are diffferent levels to RDLR
1. Top players non-trapped knee is on the ground
2. Top players non-trapped leg is based wide
3. Top players is standing




# Bottom
Goals from this position
- Stay tight, like a ball
- Do not stay squared up. Move my head toward the foot I don't have intangled
- Keep frames in that stop them from getting chest to chest
	- Keep the free leg inside of their elbow (otherwise they can squeeze through and go chest to chest, and you lose lots of attacks). I can have the foot of the leg against their hips, or worst case I can use my knee
- Keep the low knee off the ground (otherwise you get smash passed) I need to be high up their leg

At level 1 (knee on ground) try to put your outside leg under their arm pit for off balancing. 

### Transitions
- From the basic position, pinch the leg you are surrounding and press it away from you to off balance them and move a leg outside to reclaim closed guard
- In the press through put a fist on their throat/lapel, rotate/shrimp away, technical standup
- If I can grab far side sleeve and collar I can pin the hand to the ground and press them up to sweep.
- [[Kiss of the Dragon]] (From level 1)
- Spin through to [[x guard]] (from level 2)
