# Bottom
### General Advice
- Keep pressure on both arms all the times.
	- My Feet should be on the biceps, close to the inner elbow
	- My hands should have sleeve grips. 
	- If they are pulling away I should pull, if they are smashing I should push against them
- If the top player pins a knee to the ground then the bottom player should reset their grip (so it isn't around the leg) and kick their leg out to remove the pin.
- To defend against this the bottom player grabbing pant lets I should keep my legs  staggered with one arm up, and one arm down. 

### Positional names
- Lasso - A foot on the bicep goes directly down, then away from center line, then up, then into the space under the armpit. This position should reclaim control and keep them close

### Submissions from here
- [[Triangle Choke]] - To get into triangle from spider guard shoot one leg behind my partners head, with the goal of getting a high guard. Once my guard is secured then rotate my hip so that the sole of my foot is inline with their shoulders. I then chop down trying to get the bite of my knee as deep around their neck as possible. I can then lock my ankle with my other foot. If I need to move my ankle around I can grab it with my hand on the inside of my other leg.

### Sweep
- Balloon up and over
	- Put legs on hips, pull with arms
	- Put push legs while pulling with arms to float person above me
	- Push/pull them until their hands base over my head
	- with on arm get an underhook on their form arm
	- with the other hand get a scoop grip on the same side leg
	- pull my arms togeather when pressing my underhook side leg into their side
	- this should sweep them onto the ground and I can take mount

# Top
- The player on top should try to get grips on both of the bottom players pants.
	- Once grips on the pants are established then I should squeeze the legs togeather and do one of the following:
		- step back and reset to an [[Open Guard#Top]]
		- step forward and stack my partner
- The player on top should try to shoot arms inside and control the legs
- I want my knees and elbows at about the same position. 
	- Stay low, don't be to far forward or backwards.
