# Bottom
### General Advice
- Keep pressure on both arms all the times.
	- My Feet should be on the biceps, close to the inner elbow
	- My hands should have sleeve grips. 
	- If they are pulling away I should pull, if they are smashing I should push against them
- If they are trying to break the position by moving sideways I should press the leg from the side they are moving toward up and pull the other arm toward me. 
- If the top player pins a knee to the ground then the bottom player should reset their grip (so it isn't around the leg) and kick their leg out to remove the pin.
- To defend against this the bottom player grabbing pant lets I should keep my legs  staggered with one arm up, and one arm down. 

### Positional names
##### Lasso 
A foot on the bicep goes directly down, then away from center line, then up, then into the space under the armpit. This position should reclaim control and keep them close. To get a lasso guard I go from normal spider guard move my foot down, away from their torso, and then around their arm and back under their armpit. My goal is to put the instep of my foot behind their back and pull them forward.

### Submissions from here
- [[Triangle Choke]] - To get into triangle from spider guard shoot one leg behind my partners head, with the goal of getting a high guard. Once my guard is secured then rotate my hip so that the sole of my foot is inline with their shoulders. I then chop down trying to get the bite of my knee as deep around their neck as possible. I can then lock my ankle with my other foot. If I need to move my ankle around I can grab it with my hand on the inside of my other leg.

### Sweep
#### From standing
- Balloon up and over
	- Put legs on hips, pull with arms
	- Put push legs while pulling with arms to float person above me
	- Push/pull them until their hands base over my head
	- with on arm get an underhook on their form arm
	- with the other hand get a scoop grip on the same side leg
	- pull my arms together when pressing my underhook side leg into their side
	- this should sweep them onto the ground and I can take mount
#### From knees
Do not let my hips stay flat, press against spider guard side to rotate my hips.

- Basic sweep 
	- Get a lasso on one side and regular spider on the other. 
	- Pull the lasso toward me and push the spider side up up up to off balance and go over top of them.

#### 1 knee (combat base)
- If they are on their foot with the side with the lasso guard I am in an okay place. 
- Rock my shoulders away from them to create a gap between my hips and their knee. 
- Release the foot from the spider guard side (keep the lasso)
- Place my foot on the ground in front of their knee
- Stomp sweep their knee
- At the same time pull - pull their arm up toward my shoulder

# Top
- The player on top should try to get grips on both of the bottom players pants.
	- Once grips on the pants are established then I should squeeze the legs together and do one of the following:
		- Step back and reset to an [[Open Guard#Top|Open Guard Top]]
		- Step forward and stack my partner
- The player on top should try to shoot arms inside and control the legs
- I want my knees and elbows at the same distance from my partners hips. 
	- If my knees are two far back I can get triangles
	- if my knees are too far forward I can get swept
	- Stay low, don't be to far forward or backwards.
