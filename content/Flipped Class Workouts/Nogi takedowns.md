- Attacker:
	- Start: Get 1 collar tie and one outside (or wrist) grip. Step back and forth with your partner keeping the staggered stance (different front and back feet)
	- Tips:
		- when you are attacking both feet should be in air at the same time
		- You can only attack your partners FRONT foot, but you can do it while they are stepping forward & backwards.
		- Your attacking knee should be locked
		- Your toes should be pointed and rotated so the arch is up
	- Goal: get arch of foot on achilies tendon of opponent (or at least the ankle)
- Defender:
	- Start: Grab elbow of arm that has collar tie
	- Slowly build into more organic defence
