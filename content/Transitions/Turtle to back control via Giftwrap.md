When my partner is in turtle, I need to keep possession and pressure on them. I do this by placing my weight on their back. This weight can be either chest to back, or arms/hands. My end goal is to open the position in such a way where I end up in an advantageous position.

The first step in this transition is to insert a same side arm between their tricep and leg. I then want to snake through and grab the wrist of the same side. Once I have that wrist control I start working my legs to get a solid base. My opposite side leg should extend far away from the body. The same side leg should stay on its toes, but should have a bend in the knee. That bend in the knee should be placed on and under the butt of my partner. Once my legs are established I am ready for the dynamic part of this transition. I lead by punching my free arm forward, followed by my shoulders and upper body. This should destabilize myself and my partner causing us to fall forward and away from my hand that is gripped onto their wrist. When my hand/arm/shoulder gets close to the ground tuck them under my partners head as we fall. The hand that is free has a goal of meeting up with my own wrist. I should allow momentum to take us until my back in on the ground. I should also be trying to connect my feet of the inside of my partners thighs, to secure back control. From here I can seatbelt and get a traditional back control, OR I can start attacking right away.
