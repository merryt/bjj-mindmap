If in side control top if your partner tries to shrimp or grab an underhook try to get from your knees to your feet. Use your hand that is lower on their body to control their far side arm. Use your arm that is closer to their head to post behind them. Swing your leg behind their head dropping to a knee. As that is happening drop your post hand to an elbow. After those two things are done in sync you will do two additional things in unison. One is the swinging of your other leg around their body and past your hips. While that is happening shoot your hand that was your elbowed post hand through their arms looking to end with your hand near their ear/lapel. Next you want to secure your seatbelt. The final move of the sequence is sitting back and rolling them across your body as you try to get hooks in.
