STARTING_POSITION:
  - "[[Mount#Bottom]]"
---

- straighten a leg and press it outward against a foot
- Roll my hips slightly to the side that leg is extended to get some space between their knee and the ground
- Reach a leg across my leg and their leg to the outside of both. 
- Pull their leg up with my foot that is crossed over, at the same time shoot my knee under and try to capture their knee. If I can't get the knee just capturing the ankle is also useful. 
- I can put in a knee shield and enter [[Half Guard#Bottom|Half guard bottom]]
- If I am feeling explosive I can get an underhook on my near side and push them up and over my head and try to standup to grab the back.
