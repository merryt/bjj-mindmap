This position has 4 parts 
1. **Initial Engagement** This position starts from [[Open Guard]] 
2. **Legs gathered but head hasn't crossed center line.** - The ankle of the leg with the over grip being between the thighs, and the under arm is getting around the leg and starting to grab fabric (skirt or belt). 
3. **Attackers Head is over centerline but defenders knee is still on hip** 
4.  **Knee is between the attackers leg** 



# Attacking
1. Get two on one onto a leg and shove that ankle between my knees. Move my nearside arm to the pant leg, and far side arm to form a scoop grip on the farm side leg.
2. At this point the key is breaking frames and not losing balance. If they are framing well and their "under" side is high I can always adjust my position and swing to to the underside taking side control or back. If they are framing iffy against my shoulders I can rock my shoulder side to side while pulling my self closer with my under side.
3. Once my head is across the center line, lock it in place by putting my weight through my shoulder into their belly. Do not put my head to the ground unless they are bridging, put weight into their stomach through my shoulder. To progress past this position I need to progress past their near side leg. To do this an option is walking forward while pressing down and back on the pant leg that I am holding. 
4. Once I have cleared the knee line I need to clear all remaining hooks. I like to sprawl down pressing my hips into the ground. then wind shild wiper-ing over their leg.
If everything goes correctly we and in [[BJJ/Position/Side control]]


# Defending
[[Go Further Faster#Volume 03 - Guard pass retention|Go Further Faster Guard pass retention]]

Be on the look out for opertunities to go into [[Top Lock]] or [[Guillotine]]

1. ??
2. Frame cross side grip from my under side to their over side. Press my shin against their hip maintaining their distance. The dynamic motion is pressing my shin and same arm against their hip and working in tandem to free that leg. Hopefully reclaiming that arm. 
3. Walk/work my foot against their inner thigh on the underside. Once that foot is against the back side of the knee press down on it will twisting to break their position. While this is happening work my knee out and try to get closed guard.
4. This isn't an ideal place for me. I need to work to shrimp away. A way to do this is work my arm under their head, to get a solid grip. Keep my ankle sticky between their legs. Use my other arm to press against their thigh/hip. Bridge a little bit, and shrimp away, If this works well I will end up in a scramble or halfguard.
