STARTING_POSITION:
  - "[[Mount]]"
---
I start mount bottom

I use this move if my partner is postured up and has a tight grip on my with their knees, and is grip fighting for a hand (perhaps trying for a Kimora or an Americana)

1. Get an arm across my body trapped in that position. The goal here is to pull all the slack out of that side of their body. The more their back is stretched down and into the position the better
2. On the same side of the arm we are pining put my foot on the outside of their foot. (if I don't have the flexibility then adjust my hips)
3. Move head at a 45 degree angle over my shoulder on the side of the grasped arm. 
4. Arch my back and transfer weight of my upper body onto the shoulder by my head
5. Press my opposite sided foot into the ground and bridge
