# From Top
1. Get to high mount
2. Gain control of both arms in an extend state. this can be done through gathering both arms one at a time like in [[Arm Triangle]]s. 
3. Sit up on their chest with my hips rotated 90 degrees and a leg under their shoulder (under the shoulder REALLY helps out for when the arm bar is happening)
4. Post with the arm that is closest to their hips
5. Move my leg that is closest to their head to next to their head with the heal right against the head (potentially gaining a cross face)
6. Control both arms with my arm that is closer to the head, I should be reaching over one arm and grabbing the bicep of the other arm holding both tight.
7. Sit down on their chest and use my butt/weight to flatten them out. From here I am in [[S-Mount]] and can consider an [[Arm Bar]]
##### Submissions
- Fall back into a standard [[Arm Bar]] 
- Sitting [[Arm Bar]]
	- Lean forward and press my hips forward to do a seated armbar
# From Bottom
- I am in a rough spot if I got here, My best hope is wait for the armbar and defend against that.
