This guard is best done against people who are postured above me and are pressing forward into me.

In closed guard get a cross lapel grip and a 4 finger sleeve grip. In a shared motion release my guard and great a knee shield on the opposite side of my sleeve grip. My shoelaces of my knee shield side should pull my partners weight over their other knee making it a posted with most of their weight. Pull my sleeve grip to extension like I are looking at my watch. Use my non-knee shield knee to press into the knee of my opponent. As I press the knee use my foot go guide my opponent onto the mat and follow along with them holding onto my lapel grip. Ideally I end in mount top, if I fuck up I might sometimes end in a weak side control.
