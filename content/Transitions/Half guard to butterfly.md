My goal here is to scoot away from the person to create space and then fill that space with my frames against their thighs. 

If there isn't pressure I can move my inside knee out just a bit and create a knee shield against the thigh of the leg away from my other leg. 

1. Place my outside foot flat on the ground
2. Frame the on opposite side with my arm
3. Shrimp putting my butt to the side with the flat foot
4. invert my knee
5. pull my knee forward and to where my hand is
