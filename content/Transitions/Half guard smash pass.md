This position starts from [[Half Guard#Top]] and assumes their knee shield is removed and they are flattened. 

Pressing my shoulder into the side of their head (like crossface) and grab the back of their gi with the arm of my shoulder that is pressing into their head. From here my goal is to apply pressure to effect their alignment and make their leg connection weaker on my leg. I then want to transition from [[Half Guard#From deep half guard top|Deep half Guard]] to [[Shallow Half Guard#Top]] or [[Three quarter mount]]
	- If I am going to shallow half guard then from my hips to their current side and use my free hand to press their knees
	- Press my head into the ground across their body (opposite side of my free leg). Once I have stability generated from head, non cross facing arm, and both legs I can start walking, shaking my trapped knee to transition to [[Three quarter mount]]. If my leg gets stuck I can use my free hand to help the process.
