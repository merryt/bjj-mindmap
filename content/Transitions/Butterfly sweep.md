- Start from butterfly guard bottom
- Get an underhook (or grab belt) with one arm
- With the other arm go OVER their arm pinning it into my armpit.
- Fall to the side that I have their arm pinned. 
- For my leg that is higher up make sure my hook is in place. 
- Raise my leg into the air by stacking my hips and getting my knee (of the lower leg)
- If they trap my leg do a [[Leg slice]] to free the leg 

I was also taught this with out the belt where I use my free arm for extra leverage
