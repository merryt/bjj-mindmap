I start from the bottom of half guard with my knee shield up. I press my knee shield into them. if they go for an under hook I lock in my over hook. I then can switch my knee shield to being behind them. From there I can put my weight on my forarm ancor behind/under my head, and my leg which is rapped around them. My over hook keeps them locked into place from advancing. Here I can swing my inside leg out and around their back.
