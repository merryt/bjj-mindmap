This works from [[Mount]] when I am on the bottom, 

Try to get my legs inside of theirs legs make sure they are both on the ground and free. From here I can bridge onto one hip, but keeping shoulder and neck as close to the ground as possible. Take the leg from the bridged side and reach across my center line to the leg on their opposite side. Use my heal and see if I can drag their their ankle in between my legs and lock it in. I can then flatten my hips down as I use his leg as a lever. From here I press against the opposite hip and do a little shrimp to get into [[Half Guard]].
