Start from half guard bottom, make sure I have a proper knee shield in place. If their leg (non-knee shield side) is exposed I have space for this attack. From here I can shoot my arm under their leg pulling it forward as I push the knee shield and all my force toward putting their hips back. This should cause them to roll over and I can take either back control OR side control
