# General Steps
- Start from [[Closed Guard]] with both of my partners arms inside my knees (like they are grabbing at my belt, or hips)
- Get grips on their sleves 
	- Press my fingers against the out their sleeve, '
	- Place my thumbs on the inside of the sleeves 
	- Roll the sleeve around my fingertips
- Release my feet from behind their back and move them to their hips
- Rock my shoulders side to side to create a small amount of space. 
- Shoot 1 leg in for a [[Spider guard#Lasso]]
	- My leg is already outside, so I only need to go over the top and shoot into the arm pit. 
	- I want the leg to be deep so I can put my shoelaces against their back, and my knee into their bicep.
	- I really want to pull their sleeve into my inner bicep with my hand facing toward me. 
- Place my other foot on their bicep 
- I am now in [[Spider guard]]

# Notes
- If they get rowdy  when I am going for a lasso I can normally get a [[Top Lock]] or  [[Spider to Triangle]] from here.
