When I am up and my opponent is down trying to get me to engage with their feet exposed I can do a leg drag.

# Main path
##### Get the a heel
If their legs aren't exposed I can make them exposed by pushing them back, and flattening them onto their back.

##### Drag a leg across my body
A leg drag starts with a grip on the heel of my opponent on the same side. (left arm to right heal or right arm to left heal). A grip consists of one hand on the heal, and the other hand across the shoe laces. After I have a good grip on the heal I can place my other arm on top of the foot. I then drag that leg across my leg on the same side so their leg is in the middle of legs. If I can't get the leg across my body move closer to them. I can use my legs to get their leg at a 90 degree angle from their torso, and then moving the leg across my body is easier. My end state here is their leg, my knee, their leg, my body.


##### Pin leg to ground
**If their non dragged leg is outside of my legs** I can now drop my knee inbetween their legs and my arm that is on the heal to infront of their body.

**If their non dragged leg is inside of my legs** I put both of my knees between their legs pinning a leg to the ground

##### Pin their non-dragged leg to my body
ASAP use the arm that was dragging to pin their upper knee against my body. The easist way to do this is with my elbow to the top of their knee. 

##### Get underhook
Try to get an under hook behind their back otherwise they can wrestle up.

##### Press pinned leg to the ground
Next goal is to stretch their leg out across the ground. Try to put my hand behind their ankle  forcing their leg to a 90degree angle. 

##### Get side/back control
Pressing my chest into their hips as my center of gravity swing my legs around behind them and take the side or back

##### Getting to mount
Work your way into a cross face (hand under their head, shoulder to head). Make sure to drop my hip onto their leg and pin their upper leg that is closest to my cross face (they should be very twisted). Spread their legs apart, this may require me to dig my foot under their knee . Their spine should be twisted. in one motion pop your legs into mount, their body should recoil into a flat position as you release all the tention allowing you to get into mount.

# Alternative paths

If I get swept before I get the leg pin I will frequently fall with a knee or two between their legs. During this fall and after Ianding I need to capture the both legs, I do this by placing my top arm across the shins. (I CAN ALSO PULL TO THIS POSITION). I can then trap the knee that is closer to me by holding it with my lower arm then moving my upper arm's elbow onto the knee then grab the collar. From here I base with my lower arm and press through my opponents collar rolling them over. I should then be in a knee drag position.
