##### Create distance
If there is ever a gap and I want to stand up I can press my arm out toward them. 

##### Move leg back
Get my back leg behind me and align it with the direction my opponent is forcing me. 

##### Grab their knee (if possible)
If they have an exposed knee grab it with my forward arm from the outside. Move my body to the outside of their leg and grab the their calf with my other hand. I really want my body to be on the outside. 



##### Topple them. 
Stand up, 
[[Single Leg]]
