# From Guard
Steps:
- (Optional) If they have a solid grip on your gi you will need to break their grip. A way to do this is put your hands into v with the space between your thumb and palms being the base of the v. Place this V under your partners gripped hands and press away from you. 
- From guard start with a cross sleeve grip. Grab the cuff of the opposite side arm. Use the same sized arm to grab behind the elbow. 
- Pull that arm away from your opponent and across their body. The goal of this movement is to throw them out of alignment and get them to fall to the side. 
- With your non sleeve grip side grab their armpit pull yourself as close to their body as possible. 
- Twist your hips to align with your own shoulders
- Put weight on your higher leg which is now resting across their back. (Ideally your lower leg should be floating)
- Once you have plenty of weight on your higher leg, and you have pulled yourself tight against their side you can release your sleeve grip and use that arm to post away from their body. The post should be made by placing a forarm on the ground. 
- Lean your whole body away from their body toward your post which should destabilize them (kick out their knee if needed.)
- As they fall use your posted arm to create a seatbelt and claim [[Back Control]]


# From Butterfly (and half butterfly)
In half butterfly you can only arm drag the side you have the hook in from.
- Get an outside grip on a same side wrist
- Press that wrist toward their waist
- shoot your other hand into the gap between their elbow and lat, grab the back of their elbow
- Fall backwards pulling their arm across your body (the goal is for them to put this pulled hand to the ground across your body)
	- While this is happening it can be helpful to free the hook on the same side you pulled from and get it to the outside of their body
- Use the hand on the same side as you pulled from to reach around their back and grab their belt
- Keep your hook (or leg that was between their legs) in place,
- Here I have two options: 
	1. If they stay low,  start climbing up their back to establish [[Back Control]]
	2. If they raise their posture up I can get a scoop grip, roll my hips under them, and do a modified [[John Wayne Sweep]]. I want to make sure I am pinning their inside arm against my body. 


# From standing
- Start with same leg forward
- Grab wrist on same side and press forward.
- Use cross arm to shoot between elbow and lat
- Pull elbow toward me and step around to side of partner
- (optional) Put foot behind partner and pull them back
