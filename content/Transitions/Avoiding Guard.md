If I find my self standing while in [[Open Guard]] while the other person is on their butt a way to avoid getting into guard is to place a hand on the inside of a knee of the same side. I then press that knee to the ground while putting a shoulder/frame into the other leg. I can then swing my body around while swimming my arm that was on the knee through pushing their knee out of the way. After I have cleared the knee I can drop to the chest and get [[Side control]].
