Potentials to get into this position
- From [[Mount]] top, I can go for an Americana if they defend by trying to turn into it and connecting their arms grab the arm that is across their chest. hold it in place.

Once their cross arm is held in place the knee to run up their back until it is at the neck. Stay connected this entire time. Once they are fully on their side move my arm under their head and grab the wrist from the crossed arm.  From here I can use my other arm to connect to my wrist. (assuming this arm is under their crossed arm). When I am feeling secure I can then move my body perpendicular to the direction they are laying with the goal of sitting on my butt and them rolling into my lap and potentially overshooting. When we roll and over shoot I complete the seatbelt and end up in [[Back Control]]
