Starting in closed guard I off balance my partner to have hands on the ground. I can do this with an arm drag, or sleeve grip . If they grab onto my leg/pant I am in business. 
- Keep legs tight around waste
- roll to put belly on ground
- Walk hands and body up to press my partner back until they roll over
