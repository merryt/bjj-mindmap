Always keep my head on the inside, other wise I get guillotined. 

Using my head I can press against their body and pull backwards. This should cause them to destabilize and fall. I should fall with them into that partial [[Leg Drag]] position

If they press my head away that is okay. Use the forward hand that was on their knee and regrip on the inside of their leg, I can then pull back and spin our bodies to destabilize them.
