STARTING_POSITION:
  - "[[Half Guard]]"
---
From bottom position a start by making sure my knee shield is in place and I am up on the elbow opposite my knee shield. Work to get an underhook with the same arm that is doing the knee shield. Once I have that underhook drop my knee shield and use that heal to pull their leg away, form their core destabilizing them and opening their position. From here I can shrimp away and get up next to them so we are both kneeling. From here there are two options
1. I can two on 1 attack their far away leg with my hands (one on heal, and one on knee). If I pull that leg that should fall over and I can take side control
2. If they are pressing against me I can reach my arm under and grab their leg and let them push through me. when they push through me I drop and we roll over top
