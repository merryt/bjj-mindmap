This means the attacking hand/arm does not grab onto the lower hand, but the lower hand grabs onto the upper.\nElbows should always be pressed against the body and arms pulled in tightly. There should be no space between my arms and their body.\nGrip fighting from advantage:\n\nKeep the seatbelt tight. A loose seatbelt exposes several different escapes.\nThe person in the advantaged position should strive to keep their attacking elbow at or in front of the shoulder of the disadvantaged position. The clasp/grip should be under the armpit. If the grip is stripped the attacking arm ship shoot under the neck.\nPinning an arm. To do this I take my under hooked arm (preferably if it is farther off the ground then my attacking arm) and get an above grip on my partners wrist on their higher side. Detach my leg that is on the same side as my partners arm that I am grabbing. place their arm underneath my leg, using my heal to apply additional power. Regain my hook from the leg that was just moved to pin their arm between their body and my leg. This gives me a permanent 2 on 1 advantage for future grip fighting.\nIf I am in a grip fight and the person is two on one-ing my attacking hand\n\nIf both grips are a monkey grip and both palms are facing the same way I can use my non attacking hand to grab their lapel to lock them into position. I can then free my attacking hand by going down, and then pulling free. Once free I can attempt to sneak my hand under the chin by blading my hand through\nI can walk my hand up their shoulder like a spider. Once the hand is resting behind the shoulder I can do a Rear naked choke (specifically the one arm variation)\n\n\nI saw a cool system Straight Jacket System by Gordan Ryan Sample video\n\n\n\nFalling to the “good” side. The “attacking” arm is in a stronger position if its on top\nLegs\n\nBody Triangle - If the person in the back can get one of their legs across the belly, and place it behind their knee to squeeze the core that is a good spot\nAnkle Lock - The person in the back needs hooks in to maintain control, but needs to be careful not to hook to low, if the hooks of the back person are ever too low the front person can squeeze their legs together and get a submission there\nHooks spreading legs - The person in the advantaged position can place the instep of their feet on the inside of the thighs of the disadvantaged person. This gives them partial control over the legs and allows them to grip pretty well to stop escape.\nHigh feet - not locking feet, but having them high on the person is a solid choice.\nHigh locked feet -  Locking feet is OKAY, but it needs to be done above the waist\nOnly one hook - If the person in defensive position gets one hook out, but the leg is still under them, keep the foot away! Try to lever up your knee so it scoots them back to the center. Roll to the other side where you can reclaim both hooks.\n\nHead\n\nWhile attacking I want my head to be squeezing their head into my attacking arm. My head should constantly be breaking their alignment.\n\nSubmissions I know\n\nRear naked choke\nZipper\nBow and arrow\n\nReclaiming back control when I am losing it:\nIf the disadvantaged person gets their back the advantaged person will default to reclaim back control by trying to get under them to get under them. This is counter intuitive. Instead the advantaged person should attempt to roll them onto their side or by getting on top of them and pulling the seatbelt around. From here they can hook a leg around a leg and roll back into back control.\nDefending\nIf I am in the disadvantaged position of Back Control I need to be pondering “can I be submitted here” if so, stop that submission. If not, I need to be moving to transition to a better position.\nWays to stop from getting choked\n\nGrab inside of attacking elbow with lego man grip. Bench press forarm away from me\nTwo hands on attacking hand - This works best if there is a loose/no seatbelt and the attacking arm is lower to the ground. As the defender I grab the wrist of the attacking hand with both my hands. I push that arm out of the way and roll to get my back to the ground\n\n\nEasiest escapes\n\nWorm and squirm - This works is there is double underhooks or double overhooks.\n\nGoing up → if they have double underhooks I can squirm up. Grab their wrists with my hands. try to decrease pressure. From here I can walk my shoulders, step with my legs and try to go up and out.\nGoing down → If they are trying to attack with both hands I can use my feet to walk downwards. The risk here is getting trapped in a body triange, or getting submitted, so make sure to protect my neck and stop their legs from connecting.\n\n\nBack to ground - I clear these items one at a time:\n\nHook\nKnee\nHead\nFrame\nEscape\n\n\n\nThrowing off the advantaged persons alignment. I can use my head to press into their head and hopefully force their body into a less then optimal position."},"Position/Butterfly-Guard":{"slug":"Position/Butterfly-Guard","filePath":"Position/Butterfly Guard.md","title":"Butterfly Guard","links":["Transitions/Butterfly-sweep","Transitions/Arm-Drag"],"tags":[],"content":"This position is where one person who is sitting on their butt uses their insteps to hook into their opponents inner thighs.\nTop\nBottom\nPossible transitions\n\nButterfly sweep\nArm Drag\nButterfly guard to xguard\n\nGeneral notes\n\nDo not get pancaked.

An arm bar is attacking the elbow, so I need to control the shoulder. I do this by pinching their shoulder between my butt and foot. My foot is ideally on the far side of their head pressing them away from the joint attack\nJordan teaches jiujitsu tops on armbars (meh, this is a littel bit above my level. )\n\nDon’t focus on specific grips - The focus is more the arms position\nIt is okay to cross your feet (be careful when they are trying to stack you though)\ncontrol the wrist and the shoulder.\nDon’t worry about two hands during grip fighting while trying to fight\n\n\n\n\nStarting from Top Lock:\nAt this point I assume their inside arm is parallel to my spine, perhaps laying on my chest. I want to hold the arm that is on my chest with my arm that is opposite their arm. With my free arm I want to grab my shin with the opposite side hand behind their head. I then free my leg from the cross to press against the ground or hip and rotate on my back taking their arm with me. we should be spinning to break their arms alignment even furthers. After I have rotated to ~45 degrees off center I then grab their arm with both hands and hold on tight. 1 hand on the back of their elbow, and the other grabbing Gi, or wrist is ideal. At the same time I place my free leg against the side of their face and start pressing till they are off balance. At this point of their elbow is still above my belt I can start bridging.\nFar side Arm bar starting from Side control:\nSeparate their arms from their sides. I do this with elbows and knees. Pry their far arm away from their side by putting my inner elbow around their arm and pulling it up with a back extension. I need their far arm to be straight and on the side of my head that is away from their shoulders. I can use my close are from this if I need to. I then pinch their arm against my head and shoulder.  For the near arm use my knee that is closer to their hips to press in between their side and their arm. If I need to twist my body to get a better angle do so, but never give up my arm under their head or my base. As long as I have my base, and arm under their head I can cook. Once both arms are pried away from their sides I can start to transition. I do this by first trapping the near arm under my leg that is closer to their hips. I can then then pull their far arm up by my head and tilt them onto their side  so their shoulders are stacked. I need to keep something behind their back to stop them from rolling over, this could be my knee, or an arm. If their arm is at their waist it is probably better to go for a From side control.  Once they are stacked I take my free leg/foot (the one that is near their head and not pinning their leg) and place it behind their back. It should be as close to their back as possible to stop them from putting their back against the ground. Lower my butt onto the mat behind their back, and pull close to them. Then put my leg that was pinning next to their head/shoulder away from my body. I use my arms to hold their arm against my head. I can then swing my arm over their torso and lean back to finish the submission.\nNear side arm bar from Side control:\nFrom side control I can start with isolating the far side arm. I put one arm under their head, and the other arm under their far side arm. Both hands press into the shoulder. I can then put pressure into their head/neck with my shoulder and raise up onto my knees. Once on my knees I can stack their shoulders. If they are keeping their hips flat on the ground then I can transfer to Mount by slicing a knee across their stomach toward their arm pit. If they are stacking their hips, and their shoulders are still shelved on my knees then their arm is probably trying to get in between their chest and mine to create a frame, I want this. IF THEY DON’T I can arm bar from a vertical position, I can lock take an over hood on the arm that is behind my back and press my hips forward. If they do create a frame then I release my arm that is under their head and shoot it under their arm and grab into my own inner elbow, this might require a wide blade motion where I do a big arm circle. I then take my arm that is closer to theirs and grab the wrist of the arm that is nearer to me. This is called a figure 4 grip. From here I keep them shelved/stacked, and holding onto that grip. then slowly lower back toward the map, never letting go of the grip. In the process of going back I can put a leg or two over their body and go into the arm bar.\nFrom S-Mount:\nPass my free leg across their face and place my foot on the mat infront of them, and my shin on the ground under their shoulder. I should be controlling the arm connected to the elbow on that knees side. I do this by grabbing the other arm, at the bicep wrapping the target arm. If done correctly I have two paths at this point\n\nFace down - Post with my free arm, make sure the arm that is controlling them has their arm in the crook of my elbow and is close to their elbow, if I am at the wrist it is probably too weak. Lean over my posted arm and press their head back with the leg that is around their head. Bridge with hips\nClassic - If they have a strong grip that needs broken this is probably the right move. Control the arm that is closest to the leg that is across their face, do this by getting a two on one (preferably on different positions, like 1 bicep and one through and grabbing the lapel) and go backwards down onto the mat. From here start grip fighting using pre-finishing mechanics\n\nDefence:\nThe goal is to get my elbow under their belt line.\n\ngetting their lower knee into my 1/2 guard is a great way to do this, I can then rotate my body, pull out my arm and sweep their position. NEVER give up my grips in this position though.

If I need to let my leg off their face, then when they try to sit up put weight back on their face\nGrab their cross side lapel with the hand that is closer to their head, I can choke them by putting the blade of my hand against their neck\nI can use the hand that is closer to their neck to shoot inbetween their hands and with the blade of my hand pry open their grip\nI can use the inside of the hand with the lapel grip to apply upward pressure to their arm, I can then use my other hand to press down getting downward pressure and stress their forarm/elbow\nDouble up both arms under their arm. I can use the arm that is closer to their head to pull their elbow to my side. I can then rotate their arm attacking the shoulder joint which will hopefully unlock their grip and allow me to finish the position.\n"},"Submissions/Arm-Triangle":{"slug":"Submissions/Arm-Triangle","filePath":"Submissions/Arm Triangle.md","title":"Arm Triangle","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"From Mount\n\nGet my knees inside their arms\nEstablish a cross face with one arm\nWith my other arm, get under one of their elbows\nFinger walk my hands up to pull out the slack of their elbow\nUse my shoulder and core to press their elbow up. repeat previous step until their arm is above their head.\nLock their arm in place by putting my head to the ground behind their arm.

(left arm to right heal or right arm to left heal). A grip consists of one hand on the heal, and the other hand across the shoe laces. After I have a good grip on the heal I can place my other arm on top of the foot. I then drag that leg across my leg on the same side so their leg is in the middle of legs. If I can’t get the leg across my body move closer to them. I can use my legs to get their leg at a 90 degree angle from their torso, and then moving the leg across my body is easier. My end state here is their leg, my knee, their leg, my body.\nPin leg to ground\nIf their non dragged leg is outside of my legs I can now drop my knee inbetween their legs and my arm that is on the heal to infront of their body.\nIf their non dragged leg is inside of my legs I put both of my knees between their legs pinning a leg to the ground\nPin their non-dragged leg to my body\nASAP use the arm that was dragging to pin their upper knee against my body.

Make sure to drop my hip onto their leg and pin their upper leg that is closest to my cross face (they should be very twisted). Spread their legs apart, this may require me to dig my foot under their knee . Their spine should be twisted. in one motion pop your legs into mount, their body should recoil into a flat position as you release all the tention allowing you to get into mount.\nAlternative paths\nIf I get swept before I get the leg pin I will frequently fall with a knee or two between their legs. During this fall and after Ianding I need to capture the both legs, I do this by placing my top arm across the shins. (I CAN ALSO PULL TO THIS POSITION). I can then trap the knee that is closer to me by holding it with my lower arm then moving my upper arm’s elbow onto the knee then grab the collar. From here I base with my lower arm and press through my opponents collar rolling them over.
